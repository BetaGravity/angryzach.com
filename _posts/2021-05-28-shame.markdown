Dear Senator Sinema,  
 
As you sit there with the proverbial "egg all over your face," with the Jan 6th commission a steaming, complete failure, please take stock of your complicity and responsibility in squandering this moment. 
 
SHAME on you for supporting the Jim Crowe era filibuster over American democracy. While you have a cute glass of wine and pick your sorry behind up and travel back to Washington, your constituents expect you to vote to accomplish the Biden agenda, providing a positive opportunity at a good life for future generations. You likely won't...because...reasons. 
 
Me and my Independent-libertarian-minded family members' that you take for granted as 'morons not keeping track of what's happening in Washington' will NOT be voting for you in the upcoming primary nor your future elections.  
 
You couldn't be bothered to show up for the Jan 6th commission vote in the Senate and told us to "F*ck off" with your photo. You robbed Arizonans of a voice in that vote. 
 
You are a total embarrassment and need to find a job more suited for your lack of understanding of realpolitik. Perhaps you and your friends Gosar and Biggs can start a think tank. 
 
Sincerely, 
Zach
